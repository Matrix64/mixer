Classes and methods to compute the difference between a BpyDataProxy and the bpy.data collections.

It computes datablock additions, removals and renames.
This module was written before the proxy system implements differential synchronization (Proxy.diff() and Proxy.apply())
and its functionality should move into BpyDataProxy
